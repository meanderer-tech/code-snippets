##How to download objects from private S3 buckets securely into EC2 Instances
##1. Create a dedicated security policy with the following JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ListObjectsInBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>"]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllObjectActions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*Object",
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/*"]
        }
    ]
}
##2. attach this policy to an IAM role
##3. attach this role to the EC2 instance
## - An EC2 instance can only have one role at a time, 
##   if the instance already has a role, add policy to existing role instead
##4. install aws cli
##5. run the following script

#!/bin/bash
filelist=$(aws s3 ls s3://<bucket> | tr -s ' ' | cut -f4 -d' ')
arr=($filelist)
for item in ${arr[@]}; do
  aws s3 cp s3://<bucket>/$item .
done

##all of the above can be scripted if this has to be done repeatedly.
